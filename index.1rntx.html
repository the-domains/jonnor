This is the implementation shipped in Meego Netbook, and the one improved by <a href="http://people.gnome.org/~csaavedra/">Claudio Saavedra</a> (Igalia) as part of the GTK+ on MeeGo project. It was also the only one that was updated to work with the DBus connection changes that was done quite some time ago, and supporting both GTK 2 and 3. For these reasons this was the implementation integrated into mainline Maliit.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual2col-3b682ba0-b5a5-4fba-928f-a91a3e56f901" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-large color-title text-align-center d-b p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="122"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="123"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 m-a" data-reactid="124"><div class="System-font m-a Headline" data-reactid="125"><h1 data-reactid="126"><span class="" data-reactid="127"><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2010/11/glom-postgresql-setup/" class="font-title " data-reactid="128">glom-postgresql-setup</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 129 --></div><div class="Group Group--meta p-1 max-w-960px m-a" data-reactid="130"><!-- react-empty: 131 --><div class="Attribution op-70 font-title " data-reactid="132"><h5 data-reactid="133"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="134"><a href="http://www.jonnor.com">Jonnor</a></span></h5></div></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 ms-t-a-j col-2 col-gap-s m-a" data-reactid="135"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="136"><p><a href="http://www.glom.org/wiki/index.php?title=Glom">Glom</a> is an application that lets you design database systems, including user interface.
