The goal for me and the other students from Vestfold University College was to get a concrete task for our <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2009/09/senior-project-confirmed/">senior project</a> and to get up to speed on some of the things we need to get started.</p><p>The three days were heavily packed with information, so this will just be a tiny tiny summary. I will probably write up some posts explaining some parts in more detail later. If I can get a hold of the presentations given I will link them here.</p><h3>Talks/topics</h3><h4>Day 1:</h4><h5>Why parallelize and why GPGPU?</h5><p>Computing units does not scale simply by frequency anymore so we need to parallelize to increase performance. GPUs are commodity hardware designed for massive parallelism driven forward by  a huge consumer market in 3D graphics =&gt; provides high performance, low cost, is flexible and easy to use compared to DSP, FPGA, custom vector CPUs etc.</p><h5>The Nvidia CUDA platform</h5><p>Describes the underlying hardware platform and a concept for accessing this from a high level language (C with some C++ and custom extensions). Current generation has approx 200 stream processors and is designed to have several thousand threads running at the same time. There are cards especially for GP-computing (Tesla-series), but for a lot of computations the high end GeForce cards are good enough. Practically all newer GPUs from nVidia is CUDA capable, all the way from the Ion found in netbooks/net-tops.</p><h5>CUDA programming model</h5><p>Functions called kernels are executed on the device. All threads will run this same code, differentiation on which threads do what is done by using their IDs in statements. Threads are grouped into blocks, blocks are grouped into grids.  The number of threads/blocks is specified on kernel invocation and used for scaling to different devices. Memory is divided into several parts, each of which needs be handled manually. Device &lt;=&gt; host transfers is also done manually.</p><h4>Day 2:</h4><h5>The TPC and HLT in ALICE.</h5><p>Incredibly high data rates, not feasible or wanted to store all raw data  =&gt; some processing/analysis needs to be done in real-time ("online"). This can be done now using a large cluster of machines (the HLT). Using GPUs will allow this cluster to consist of a smaller number of nodes =&gt; cheaper and will free resources for other things like offline analysis.</p><h5>Optimizing CUDA code.</h5><p>Calculations are fast, (global) memory is slow =&gt; Focus on reducing and optimizing memory access. Designed for massive parallelism =&gt; make sure your problem sizes are big enough and that you're split the problem in a good way.</p><h4>Day 3:</h4><h5>OpenCL</h5><p>Basically the CUDA model + vendor/platform independence - C++ features, otherwise only minor differences =&gt; Should be easy to port to and understand when you know CUDA. Implementations on the way, also for CPUs (x86 with SSE and Cell) and DSPs (Texas Instruments). Likely to be a good candidate for scientific computing in the future.</p><h5>CUDA-ified tracking code</h5><p>We had a look at how CUDA has been implemented to do a task within the AliRoot framework used in the HLT allready. Some concept mismatches leads to having to wrap code in somewhat ugly ways.  Further uglified/complicated by the fact that the same code should be able to run on either the CPU or GPU.</p><h5>Our task: Vertex finding</h5><p>More about this in a later post!</p><h3>Other</h3><p>I brought a camera along, but as I'm not used to having one with me I completely forgot to take pictures. We did get to see Bergen a little bit, tho we spent most of our time on the CUDA/CERN stuff.<br> And there was rain. Every day, all day pretty much. Not sure how I'd cope with that if I lived there.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=36&amp;md5=39c681a54a8251d31a798a6120510076"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-d21db62c-f116-41b4-ab33-d23f6aebfcc3" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="27"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="28"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>I know spring is here when:</p><ul><li>Exams are so close I go to school on Saturdays</li><li>I can go mountain-biking without having to use long tights and jacket, and most of the snow is gone on the trails</li><li>Work at the bikeshop is so busy that I don't have time to greet my colleagues until 5 minutes <em>past</em> closing time</li><li>Allergies are starting to kick in</li></ul><p>Spring is great, mostly cause it means summer is close; soon schools out and the weather apt for swimming.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=155&amp;md5=814798795747afd052f9b9f4a68050ef"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-62cdc9bf-64a6-4050-9962-c3e87b444984" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="29"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="30"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>At <a href="http://thegrid.io/">The Grid</a> we do a lot of computationally heavy work server-side, in order to produce websites from user-provided content. This includes image analytics (for understanding the content), constraint solving (for page layout) and image processing (optimization and filtering to achieve a particular look). Currently we serve some thousand sites, with some hundred thousands sites expected by the time we've completed beta - so scalability is a core concern.</p><p>All computationally intensive work is put as jobs in a AMQP/ <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> message queue, which are consumed by <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> workers. To make it easy to manage many queues and worker roles we also use <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2015/06/announcing-msgflo-a-distributed-fbp-runtime">MsgFlo</a>.<br> This provides us with the required flexibility to scale: the queues buffer the in-progress work, broker distributes evenly between available workers, and with Heroku we can change number of workers with one command. But, it still leaves us with the decision on how much compute capacity to provision. And when load is dynamic, it is tedious &amp; inefficient to do it manually - especially as Heroku bills workers used by the second.</p><p>If we would instead regulate this every 1-5 minute based on demand, we would reduce costs. Or alternatively, with a fixed budget, provide a better quality-of-service. And most importantly, let developers worry about other things.</p><p>Of course, there already exists <a href="https://github.com/the-grid/guv/blob/master/doc/braindump.md#prior-art">a number of solutions</a> for this<a href="https://github.com/the-grid/guv/blob/master/doc/braindump.md#prior-art">.</a> However, some used particular metrics providers which we were not using, some used metrics with unclear relationship to required workers (like number of users), or had unacceptable limitations (only one worker per service, only run as a service with pay-by-number-of-workers).</p><h3>guv</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/the-grid/guv">guv</a> 0.1 implements a simple proportional scaling model. Based the current <em>number of jobs</em> in the queue, and an estimate of <em>job processing time</em> - it calculates the number of workers required for all work to be completed within a configured </p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/system-model-whitebg.png"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/system-model-whitebg-1024x389.png"></a><p>The deadline is the maximum time you allow for your users to wait for a completed job. The job processing time [average, deviation] can be calculated <a href="https://github.com/msgflo/msgflo/blob/master/src/utils/newrelic.coffee">from metrics</a> of previous jobs. And the number of jobs in queue is read directly from RabbitMQ.</p><pre><code># A simple guv config for one worker role. # One guv instance typically manages many worker roles '*':   app: my-heroku-app analyze:   queue: '<a href="http://analyze.IN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analyze.IN</a>' # RabbitMQ queue name worker: analyzeworker # Heroku dyno role name   process: 20   deadline: 120.0 min: 1 # keep something always running max: 15 # budget limits </code></pre><p>Now there are a couple limitations of this model. Primarily, it is completely reactive; we do not attempt to predict how traffic will develop in the future. Prediction is after all terribly tricky business - better not go there if it can be avoided.<br> And since it takes a non-zero amount of time to spin up a new worker (about 45-60 seconds), on a sudden spike in demand may cause some jobs to miss a tight deadline, as the workers can't spin up fast enough. To compensate for this, there is some simple hysteresis: scale up more aggressively, and scale down a bit reluctanctly - we might need the workers next couple of minutes.</p><p>As a bonus, guv includes some integration with common metrics services: The <a href="https://www.statuspage.io/">statuspage.io</a> metrics about 'jobs-in-flight' on <a href="http://status.thegrid.io/">status.thegrid.io</a>, come directly from guv. And using <a href="http://newrelic.com/insights">New Relic Insights</a>, we can analyze how the scaling is performing.</p><p>If we had a manual scaling with a constant number over 48 hours period, workers=35 ( <em>Max</em>), then we would have paid at least 3-4 times more than we did with autoscaling (difference in size of area under Max versus area under the 10 minute line). Alternatively we could have provisioned a lower number of workers, but then with spikes above that number - our users would have suffered because things would be taking longer than normal.</p><p>We've been running this in production since early June. Back then we had 25 users, where as now we have several thousand. Apart from updating the configuration to reflect service changes we do not deal with scaling - the minute to minute decisions are all done by guv. Not much is planned in terms of new features for guv, apart from <a href="https://github.com/the-grid/guv/issues/43">some</a><a href="https://github.com/the-grid/guv/issues/45">more</a><a href="https://github.com/the-grid/guv/issues/46">tools</a> to analyze configuration.

So after some discussion at <a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/">LGM in Leipzig</a>, I started writing one based on <a href="http://gegl.org/">GEGL</a>, the image processing library that will power the upcoming GIMP 2.10 release. The library provides a demand-driven graph-based API , with a ton of <a href="http://gegl.org/operations.html">operations included</a> and support for GPU processing using OpenCL.</p><h3>Runtime</h3><p>For creating image processing pipelines for the server, <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/imgflo">imgflo</a> acts as a runtime for <a href="http://flowhub.io/">Flowhub</a>, our <a href="https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui">open source</a> visual programming IDE. It adds to the existing NoFlo browser, Node.js and <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2013/11/microflo-0-2-0-visual-arduino-programming/">MicroFlo</a> microcontroller runtime targets, all possible thanks to the runtime-agnostic  <a href="http://noflojs.org/documentation/protocol/">protocol.</a></p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/imgflo-caged-cassowary-light.png"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/imgflo-caged-cassowary-light-1024x558.png"></a><p>The preview is live and changes whenever changes are made to the graph. This allows to quickly experiment and develop new graphs.</p><h3>Server</h3><p>As a server, imgflo provides a simple HTTP API where you specify the input image as an URL, the graph to process it through and any parameters exposed on that graph.</p><p>Processed images are cached, so that subsequent request on the same url just returns the image out of the cache.<br> The git repository includes configuration and build setup for Heroku, so deploying an instance is a 5 minute job.</p><h3>Next</h3><p>imgflo 0.1 is now minimally useful as image processing server, but there are many more <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/imgflo/issues?labels=enhancement">enhancements</a> on the todo list. Scalability and integration with NoFlo are two big topics, as as expanding the pool of available operations and graphs. <a href="http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Hacking:Porting_filters_to_GEGL">Porting filters from GIMP</a> to GEGL is a way of helping with the latter.</p><p>Additionally it would be interesting to provide a way of using imgflo with GIMP. First of all one could use graphs made with Flowhub via GEGL <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/imgflo/issues/9">meta-operations</a>. A more crazy idea is to <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/imgflo/issues/10">integrate directly</a>,  using Flowhub as a companion node-based editor.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=690&amp;md5=bc6a6ca7cb163bafb7b8236ce90bc18d"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-bd5e6429-4afc-4ef2-8555-d3ce7538adb8" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="33"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="34"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>When I announced the <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2014/04/imgflo-0-1-an-image-processing-server-and-flowhub-runtime/">first release</a> of the imgflo project in April, it was perhaps difficult to see what exactly it was useful for and why we are developing it. This has changed now as 3 weeks ago we launched <a href="http://thegrid.io/">The Grid</a>, our <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/08/the-grid-uses-artificial-intelligence-to-design-your-websites-for-you">AI-based web publishing</a> platform. We are on a bold mission to have "websites build themselves"; because until posting to personal websites becomes easier and more rewarding than posting to social media, content on the web will continue to pile up in closed silos.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/thegrid-5k-join.png"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/thegrid-5k-join-300x90.png"></a><p>To help solve this problem we built several open source technologies:</p><p><a href="http://noflojs.org/">NoFlo</a>: for creating highly testable, component-based, distributed software.<br><a href="http://flowhub.io/">Flowhub</a>: for visually and interactively building programs and extensions.<br><a href="http://gridstylesheets.org/">GSS</a>: for building constraint-based, responsive layouts<br> And of course <a href="http://imgflo.org/">imgflo</a>: for on-demand server-side image processing.</p><p>In total over 100k lines of code, and around 5000 commits over the last 12 months. Some of the stack is expained in more detail in a recent <a href="http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/artificial-intelligence-designs-websites-uses-open-technology-stack">interview with Libre Graphics World</a>.</p><h3>imgflo on The Grid</h3><p><a href="http://thegrid.io/">thegrid.io</a> launch site is of course built with The Grid. In the particular layout filter used, the look &amp; feel is driven largely by the content. Colors for text captions are extracted from tweets and social media posts, and the featured images are largely unfiltered. Other Grid layout filters may style all provided content, including images, towards a uniform look specified by a color scheme. Or a layout filter may mix-and-match content- versus style-driven design.</p><p>The background texture on this section was created with imgflo, by passing the featured image through a blur graph:</p><p><a href="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1ff47cef6f354fe0fbdefbf5e12dba2c/gaussianblur?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.thegrid.io%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fgrid-chrome.jpg&amp;width=1300&amp;height=768&amp;std-dev-x=25&amp;std-dev-y=25">https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1ff47cef6f354fe0fbdefb...Fimages%2Fgrid-chrome.jpg&amp;width=1300&amp;height=768&amp;std-dev-x=25&amp;std-dev-y=25</a></p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/thegridio-imgflo-bg-texture.png"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/thegridio-imgflo-bg-texture-300x153.png"></a><p>It is important to note that no-one chose this exact image to be used in the particular layout section (and thus have the given image filter applied), which is why processing happens on-demand. The layout section with image inside a computer screen is <em>available</em> for content which has images of type "screenshot". This property may be automatically detected by our image analytics pipeline, or manually annotated by user. The system allows describing many other such <em>constraints,</em> which are all taken into account when it works to create the appropriate layout <em>for given content</em>.</p><p>Even without considering styling, imgflo has a couple of important roles on a Grid site. Important is the ability create multiple scaled down versions to optimize download size. For this we also created a helper library called <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/rig-up">RIG</a>, which is used to generate a set of CSS media-queries with imgflo request urls.</p><pre><code> &gt; rig = require 'rig-up' &gt; css = rig content, serverconfig, 'passthrough', parameters, ...  # passthrough is name of the graph to process through   <a href="https://twitter.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@media</a> (max-width: 503px) { .media, .background { background-image: url('<a href="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/apikey/6bb56129dc707894baa88d10a02a12b9/passthrough?input=https%3A%2F%2Fa.com%2Fb.png&width=400&height=225'" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/apikey/6bb56129dc707894baa88d10a02a12b9/passthrough?input=https%3A%2F%2Fa.com%2Fb.png&amp;width=400&amp;height=225'</a>); } } <a href="https://twitter.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@media</a> (min-width: 504px) and (max-width: 1007px) { .media, .background { background-image: url('<a href="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/apikey/d099f7222293d335a6192d742f523bfa/passthrough?input=https%3A%2F%2Fa.com%2Fb.png&width=800&height=450'" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/apikey/d099f7222293d335a6192d742f523bfa/passthrough?input=https%3A%2F%2Fa.com%2Fb.png&amp;width=800&amp;height=450'</a>); } } </code></pre><p>Processing images through imgflo also means that they are cached. So if the original image becomes unavailable, the website still has versions it can use. This can happen for instance on Twitter when people change their profile picture.<br> Note that while we optimize images when presented on site, we don't touch the original image (non-destructive). This means image uploaded to The Grid has the full data &amp; metadata preserved, unlike on some other social/web services. However, we are currently not <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/imgflo/issues/68">preserving metadata in processed images</a>.</p><h3>imgflo 0.2</h3><p>imgflo is now split into three repositories, the <a href="http://github.com/jonnor/imgflo">GEGL-based Flowhub runtime</a>, the <a href="http://github.com/jonnor/imgflo-server">HTTP API server</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/jonnor/imgflo">native dependencies</a>. The runtime itself is plain C with glib, and could be used in non-web applications for desktop, mobile or embedded.</p><p>A major feature is that processing requests can now be authenticated, so that non-legitimate users cannot disrupt legitimate ones by overloading the server. We also use Amazon S3 for caching processed images, offloading a large portion of the work. Servicing 10k++ visits a day with a 2-dyno Heroko app has been no problem with this setup.</p><p>In imgflo-server we've also added support for using different processors than imgflo (which uses GEGL), in particular NoFlo with <a href="https://github.com/noflo/noflo-canvas">noflo-canvas</a>. One can now build and deploy image processing pipelines using JavaScript, including all the libraries that work with the &lt;canvas&gt; element.</p><p>Full details about the changes can be found in the changelogs: <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/imgflo-server/blob/master/CHANGES.md">server</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/imgflo/blob/master/CHANGES.md">runtime</a>.</p><h3>Scale</h3><p>Flowhub provides imgflo a node-based visual &amp; interactive IDE for developing new image filters for The Grid. It is similar to etablished tools like FilterForge, the Blender compositor,  vvvv and nuke - which many designers and visual artists are familiar with. However there are still many snags in the workflow for non-technical people. Smoothing out these is major part of the next imgflo milestone.<br> After that the focus will be on horizontal scalability, to handle the load as The Grid enters beta and opens to founding members in spring.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=767&amp;md5=4488157d98e85c1958b9fabdd087e07a"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-cf60c0f4-9bf5-4321-9dd3-bdf616c7201d" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="35"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="36"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>Its been nearly 6 months since the <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2013/11/microflo-0-2-0-visual-arduino-programming/">previous release</a> of MicroFlo, which was the first that allowed you to visually program your Arduino using NoFlo UI. While we are still just getting started, lots of things have changed since then.</p><h3>Flowhub</h3><p><a href="http://flowhub.io/">Flowhub</a> is the name of the officially supported, packaged and hosted version of the open source NoFlo UI. This is the IDE used for programming with MicroFlo, and a lot of work has been put into it the last couple of months. <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/flowhub-beta/"><em>Today we released the beta version</em></a>.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/flowhub-beta-is-here-tight.png"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/flowhub-beta-is-here-tight.png"></a><p>You can test it out for browser, node.js and microcontrollers <a href="http://flowhub.io/documentation/">now</a>.</p><p>Other runtimes are in development, and you can add your own by implementing the <a href="http://noflojs.org/documentation/protocol/">FBP runtime protocol</a>. For instance there are runtimes for <a href="https://github.com/noflo/noflo-gnome">desktop development</a> for GNOME, <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2014/04/imgflo-0-1-an-image-processing-server-and-flowhub-runtime/">image processing</a> using GEGL, <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/sndflo">audio synthesis</a> using SuperCollider and <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/protoflo">for Python</a>.</p><h3>Heterogenous FBP</h3><p>Often microcontrollers act as sensors and actuators in a larger system, where embedded computers, mobile devices and servers are used to provide the data storage and processing as well as user interfaces and connectivity with other systems.</p><p>With MicroFlo 0.3 one can visually create a microcontroller program, and then export ports on this program to make the entire microcontroller available as a component in NoFlo on node.js. This allows to seamlessly create programs which combine microcontrollers and embedded computers.<br> We made use of this functionality when we <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/ingress-table/">created an interactive table</a> that shows the status of the Ingress virtual reality game.</p><h3>Platform support</h3><p>MicroFlo has worked on AVR-based Arduinos from day 1, but it was always the goal to not be specific to Arduino. Therefore I'm happy to say that there are now basic platform implementations for:</p><ul><li>AVR-based Arduino and derivatives</li><li>Atmel AVR8 (without using Arduino)</li><li>mbed LPC1768 (ARM Cortex M3)</li><li>Texas Instruments Tiva-C (ARM Cortex M4)</li><li>Embedded Linux (RPi, BeagleBone Black)</li></ul><p>Basic bring-up up of new platform can be done in a couple of days, and components which do not use platform-dependent libraries can be used immediately. The goal is to be portable enough that you can pick up whatever capable device you find in your parts-bin, prototype your initial code there - then move the program over to a more ideal device if/when appropriate.<br> If you have particular platforms you'd like to see supported, <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/microflo/issues/24">leave a note</a>.</p><h3>Simulation &amp; Automated testing</h3><p>Automated testing in the embedded world using C/C++ is very painful compared to that of recent web technologies. CoffeScript (or JavaScript) in combination with a modern BDD framework like Mocha makes for simple and beautiful tests.</p><blockquote><p>MicroFlo enables automated BDD testing of microcontroller programs from JavaScript! <a href="https://t.co/VnTSLORSGl">https://t.co/VnTSLORSGl</a><a href="http://t.co/noOEf5BxAe">pic.twitter.com/noOEf5BxAe</a></p><p>- Jon Nordby (<a href="https://twitter.com/jononor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@jononor</a>) <a href="https://twitter.com/jononor/statuses/427498832012648448">January 26, 2014</a></p></blockquote><p>These tests are ran in a simulator which implements the MicroFlo I/O backend (C++) in JavaScript using a Node.js addon. Unfortunately there are not many good open source instruction-level simulators for the platforms MicroFlo support, so the platform backends can only be tested once we support <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/microflo/issues/13">on-device testing</a>.</p><p>Automated testing is a critical piece to making sure that MicroFlo is not only a fun and rewarding way to create microcontroller programs, but also an excellent way to make industrial quality devices.</p><h3>Easier to get started</h3><p>MicroFlo now ships a Chrome app, used to let Flowhub communicate with the MicroFlo runtime running on device over serial/USB/Bluetooth. This means  it is no longer neccesary to run node.js in a terminal, removing a usability issue in getting started.</p><p>In the future, this functionality will be baked into the Flowhub Chrome app itself. With time component code editing, building the firmware and flashing the device will also be available there, making Flowhub a true integrated development environment for MicroFlo.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=700&amp;md5=1c579ec2bfcdea3392366545f1bd8949"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-e441704e-89e9-41ab-b49d-8022be07e8aa" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="37"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="38"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>Lately I've been playing with microcontrollers again; Atmel AVRs with and without <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> boards. I've make a couple of tiny projects myself, helped an artist friend do interactive works and helped to integrated a microcontroller it in an embedded product at work. With Arduino, one does not have to worry about interrupts, registers and custom hardware programmers to get things done using a microcontroller. This has opened the door for many more people that pre-Arduino. But the Arduino language is just a collection of C++ classes and functions, users are still left with telling the microcontroller how to do things; "first do this, then this, then this...".</p><p>I think always having to work on such a a low level limits what people make with Arduino, both in who's able to use it and what current users are able to achive. So, I created a new experimental project: <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/microflo">MicroFlo</a>. It has a couple of <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/microflo#goals">goals</a>, the two first being the most important:</p><blockquote><p>People should not need to understand text-based, C style programming to be able to program microcontrollers. But those that do know it should be able to use that knowledge, and be able to mix-and-match it with higher-level paradims within a single program.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It should be possible to verify correctness of a microcontroller program in an automated way, and ideally in a hardware-independent manner.</p></blockquote><p>Inspired by <a href="http://noflojs.org/">NoFlo</a>, and designed for integration with it, MicroFlo implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">Flow-based programming</a> (FBP). In FBP, a program is constructed by connecting a set of independent components. Each component has in-ports and out-ports, and can only communicate with eachother through these. The connections can be defined using programatically, using a declarative text language,  or using a visual editor. 2D/3D artists will recognise this the concept from node compositors like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+node+compositor">Blender</a>, sound artists from applications like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?q=reaktor+programming">Reaktor</a>.</p><h3>Current status: A fridge</h3><p>I have an old used fridge, by the looks of it made in the GDR some time before I was born. Not long after I got it, the thermostat broke and the cooler would not turn off. Instead of throwing it away and getting a new one, which would be the cool and practical* thing to do, I decided to fix it. Using an Arduino and MicroFlo.<br> * especially considering that it is several months since it broke...</p><p>A fridge is a simple system, something that should be simple for hobbyists to create. So it was a decent first usecase to test the framework on. Principially, such a system looks something like this:</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/fridge-principle.jpg"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/fridge-principle-1024x591.jpg"></a><p>The thermostat decides whether to turn the cooler on or off, and the cooler switch realizes this decision. There are many alternative methods of implemening each of these two components. I used a DS1820 digital thermometer IC to read temperature, and a hacked NEXA remote controlled relay for the switch.<br> All the logic, including temperature threshold is done in software on an Arduino Uno.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/fridge-hardware.jpg"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/fridge-hardware-190x300.jpg"></a><p>The code below for the cooler switch would have been simpler (a oneliner, left as excersise for the reader) if I instead had used a active high relay directly on the mains (illegal if not a certified electrician). Or alternatively reverse-engineered the 433Mhz protocol used.</p><p>MicroFlo code for the fridge, in the <a href="http://noflojs.org/documentation/fbp/">.FBP</a> domain specific language ( <a href="https://github.com/jonnor/microflo/blob/master/examples/fridge.fbp">examples/fridge.fbp</a>)<br><code># Thermostat<br> timer(Timer) OUT -&gt; TRIGGER thermometer(ReadDallasTemperature)<br> thermometer() OUT -&gt; IN hysteresis(HysteresisLatch)</code></p><p># On/Off switch<br> hysteresis() OUT -&gt; IN switch(BreakBeforeMake)<br> switch() OUT1 -&gt; IN ia(InvertBoolean) OUT -&gt; IN turnOn(DigitalWrite)<br> switch() OUT2 -&gt; IN ic(InvertBoolean) OUT -&gt; IN turnOff(DigitalWrite)<br> # Feedback cycle to switch required for syncronizing break-before-make logic<br> turnOn() OUT -&gt; IN ib(InvertBoolean) OUT -&gt; MONITOR1 switch()<br> turnOff() OUT -&gt; IN id(InvertBoolean) OUT -&gt; MONITOR2 switch()</p><p># Config<br> '5000' -&gt; INTERVAL timer() # milliseconds<br> '2' -&gt; LOWTHRESHOLD hysteresis() # Celcius<br> '5' -&gt; HIGHTHRESHOLD hysteresis() # Celcius<br> '["0x28", "0xAF", "0x1C", "0xB2", "0x04", "0x00", "0x00", "0x33"]' -&gt; ADDRESS thermometer()<br> board(ArduinoUno) PIN9 -&gt; PIN thermometer()<br> board() PIN12 -&gt; PIN turnOff()<br> board() PIN11 -&gt; PIN turnOn()</p><p>Is the above solution nicer than using the Arduino IDE and writing in C++? At the moment maybe not significantly so. But it does prove that this kind of high-level dynamic programming model is feasible to implement also on devices with 2kB RAM and 32kB program memory. And it is a starting point for more interesting exploration.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>I will continue to experiment with using MicroFlo for new projects, to develop more components and test/validate the architecture and programming model. I also need to read through all of the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/paul_morrison">canonical book on FBP</a> by <a href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/">J. Paul Morrison</a>.</p><p>Some bigger things that I want to add include:</p><ul><li>Ability to introspect the graph running on the device, in particular the packets moving between components.</li><li>Automated testing (of the framework, individual components and application graphs)  using  JavaScript <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> test frameworks like Mocha or Vows.</li><li>Ability to change graphs at runtime,  and then persist it to EEPROM so it will be loaded on next reset.</li></ul><p>And eventually: Allowing to manipulate and monitor running graphs visually, using the NoFlo development environment.

Applications then communicate with the server (and by extension, the IM) through an IPC.</p><p>This allows for a single instance of Maliit to serve all applications, which is memory efficient and robust. A crash in a Maliit IM plugin cannot take down the application and risk loss of significant user data. The disadvantage is the increased system complexity (a separate server process needs to be running at all times*) and requiring compositing of the application and input method windows. The latter can be quite challenging to do in a well-performing way on low-powered mobile/embedded devices. See <a href="http://blog.jpetersen.org/2012/01/25/compositing-in-maliit/">Jans blogpost</a> for how we handled that on the Nokia N9.</p><p>* By default we make use of DBus autostarting, of course.</p><h3>Application-hosted Maliit</h3><p>To make Maliit more suitable for systems where only a single application runs (embedded) or compositing performance is not good enough, we now also allow Maliit to be "application-hosted": the Maliit server and input method plugins lives in the application process, not a separate server process. Enabling this feature has been a long running task of mine: All the code in input-context and server was made transport independent, a direct transport (no IPC) was introduced, and setting up the server for a given configuration (X11, QPA, app-hosted) was simplified. Other motivations for this work include being able to run the server and IM plugin easily for automated end-to-end system or acceptance testing, or just to easily start the server with a given IM plugin loaded for quick manual testing during development (see Michaels <a href="https://gitorious.org/maliit/maliit-framework/merge_requests/163">merge request</a>).</p><p>An example application exists as part of the Maliit SDK that demonstrates the feature: <a href="https://gitorious.org/maliit/maliit-framework/trees/master/examples/apps/embedded">maliit-exampleapp-embedded</a></p><p>This works by having a special input-context "MaliitDirect" which instead of connecting to the server over DBus, creates the server and a direct connection. As when running standalone the server will instantiate and manage the necessary input method plug-ins.</p><p>Because the IM does not have its own window in this configuration, the application is responsible for retrieving the IM widget from the server, and re-parenting it into the appropriate place in the widget hierarchy. For all other purposes the application uses the same interface as if the IM was hosted remotely, making sure the abstraction is not broken and that one can easily use the application with Maliit deployed in different configuration.</p><p>This feature currently works with Qt4 applications, and is in Maliit since the latest release (0.90.0). One issue is that with the current input method API, the plugin assumes a fullscreen window; overlays extending the base area of the IM will be clipped and size needs to be overridden. This is something we <a href="https://gitorious.org/maliit/maliit-framework/merge_requests/145">are fixing</a> in the new <a href="https://wiki.maliit.org/Ideas/New_Plugin_Interface">improved API</a>.</p><h3>Compositor-hosted Maliit</h3><p>Another approach to make rendering perform better is to host the input method in the process responsible for the compositing. This also reduces the number or processes involved in rendering/compositing, and the associated overhead. This could be a X11 compositing window manager (like KWin or mcompositor), but a more realistic use-case is a Wayland compositor (for instance based on <a href="http://devqt.blogspot.com/2011/03/qt-compositor.html">QtCompositor</a>).</p><p>The API allows the consumer to inject an class instance for the configuration dependent logic, allowing to integrate the Maliit server with the logic in the rest of the compositor. Applications will use the normal "Maliit" inputcontext and communicate to the server through an IPC like DBus.</p><p>After the work with application-hosted Maliit, this feature was completed by making the server and connection libraries available as public API. The API is available in the latest  Maliit release (0.90.0), but is considered unstable until Maliit hits the <a href="https://wiki.maliit.org/Roadmap">1.0</a> mark.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=541&amp;md5=e1d3e93f5cf5f9709a1699f490e75b2f"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-150ea5fc-4de3-49aa-b5ab-428c53c106c3" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="43"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="44"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>A first set of performance improvements for the brush engine has just landed in MyPaint master. The goals for this work for me were, in priority: a) Making sure that moving to <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2012/05/mypaint-and-goats-at-lgm2012/">a GEGL backend in MyPaint</a> does not reduce performance, b) Improve performance when integrating the MyPaint brush engine in other applications, and lastly c) Improving the performance in MyPaint itself.</p><em>TL;DR: * Users of the soon-to-be-released MyPaint 1.1 should experience about 15% faster drawing of strokes for medium to big brushes. * <em>Switching to the GEGL based backed for MyPaint 1.2 is now both feasible and highly desirable from a performance perspective.</em></em><h3>Optimizations</h3><p>The optimizations are implemented through three complimentary strategies:</p><p>All dab drawing operations that happen as a result of a motion update event are queued up. When the brush engine has calculated where all dabs should go, tiles are fetched, all dabs drawn and the tiles updated. This in contrast to before where each dab drawing operation would fetch and update tiles.</p><p>The tiles to be processed are divided evenly between processing threads (one per core). Each tile is processed completely independent of other tiles, so there is no locking or synchronization in the drawing code. The tile backing store must naturally be thread-safe and may ensure this using locks.</p><p>Within each tile we attempt to make use of auto-vectorization to create the brush dab mask and do the composition of the dab onto the tile. Currently this is only implemented for a part of the mask calculation.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Details of the results and how they can be reproduced is found in the <a href="https://mail.gna.org/public/mypaint-discuss/2012-11/msg00003.html">original email thread</a>.</p><p>Starting with the lowest priority goal, but the most relevant to users; performance impact on MyPaint right now.</p><p>In terms of raw speed of drawing brushes to onto the underlying surface, speedups range from 20% to 50% for larger brushes (16 px+). This sets an upper boundary for the speedup perceived by the user.</p><p>Looking at the UI-enabled benchmarks of MyPaint, which is doing everything a normal application instance does, including layer compositing and rendering to screen, around 15% speedup was observed.  As the UI benchmark only tests a single brush at size=8.0px, it is possible that larger brushes will a higher speedup.</p><em>Users of the soon-to-be-released MyPaint 1.1 should experience about 15% faster drawing of strokes for medium to big brushes.</em><p>Note that the backend in use does not make use of the multi-threading introduced by (2) due to the tile store not being thread-safe and that it already had a cache to mitigate the problem fixed by (1).<br> Note</p><p>So in terms of raw surface rendering speed, the GEGL based backend is now significantly faster than the Python-based one. With 1 and 2 threads it is respectively up to 25% and 100% faster for big brush sizes. With 6 threads, it can be up to 4 times faster.</p><p><em>Switching to the GEGL based backed for MyPaint 1.2 is now both feasible and highly desirable from a performance perspective</em>.</p><p>Note that to see UI performance increases approaching the raw surface drawing performance increase we may also need to do the layer compositing multi-threaded.</p><p>I'm trying to convince the Krita guys to update to the new version and to provide some feedback on the impact. Other consumers of the MyPaint brush engine do not tend to communicate much with us (some are proprietary).<br> I have strong hopes that (1) should increase their performance radically as their tile get/set cost is significantly higher than in the MyPaint case: They need to convert between the internal Krita and the MyPaint brush engine working colorspace each time. They may also be able to enable multi-threading and see speedups similar to the GEGL-based backend as a result.</p><h3>Future Work</h3><p>This is only lays the groundwork of better optimized MyPaint brush engine, many areas have room for improvement. For one only a small subset of the heavy code is vectorized. There may be inner loops that can be tweaked. It may be that, with a different tile access pattern compared to before, a different tile size would be more ideal. Perhaps doing the expensive calculation of the brush dab could be avoided some times by caching them... Thinking bigger, one could move all the drawing (and rendering) to the GPU.</p><p>More details on these ideas can be found <a href="http://gitorious.org/mypaint/mypaint/blobs/HEAD/brushlib/PERFORMANCE">here</a>.

It was an introduction to MyPaint as a creative tool, how it combines raster and vector (piksels and lines) concepts, and my perspective on interoperability between libre graphics applications.</p><a href="http://piksel.no/dmmdb//contents/piksellines420120706-102121-b-dl.ogg"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/2012-06-11-142050_1280x1600_scrot_crop.png"></a><h3>Workshop</h3><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/P1050978_medium.jpeg"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/P1050978_medium-300x225.jpg"></a><p>I had hoped to hack some code for one of my existing ideas during the workshops. That did not happen. Instead I ended up hacking specifications. Maybe that is just as good. Hacking one can always do later, hashing out and documenting ideas has to be done while it is fresh.</p><p>First the results of some discussions with &#216;yvind Kol&#229;s, the <a href="http://gegl.org/">GEGL</a> maintainer:</p><p><strong>A journal for GEGL</strong>: transaction log over changes made to a GEGL graph. <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl/tree/docs/journal.txt">Specification</a>. <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gegl-developer-list/2012-June/msg00004.html">Discussion</a>. This feature would allow for applications based on GEGL to:</p><ul><li>Implement non-linear histories (undo/redo), and a timeline of the changes</li><li>Store the history in a document like OpenRaster</li><li>Share the history between different applications</li><li>Let multiple applications to work on the same document at the same time</li></ul><p><strong>A strategy for improved file format support in GEGL</strong>, and using this to improve  file support and interoperability in libre graphics applications. <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gegl-developer-list/2012-June/msg00003.html">Proposed plan</a>.</p><p>Executing this plan would move a lot of the existing file format support from GIMP (PSD, XCF, OpenRaster) down into GEGL so that it can be reused across applications. And would then let GEGL provide image support plugins for GdkPixbuf and QImage - so that at the very least - previews will work <em>everywhere</em>.</p><p>Chatting with Egil M&#246;ller, creator of Sketchspace, also resulted in:</p><p><strong>A web based system supporting a continuous work-flow from free-hand</strong><br><strong> sketch to finished product</strong>. <a href="http://beta.primarypad.com/p/sketchspaced">Concept and mockups</a></p><p>"Imagine starting from a freehand drawing or imported raster image and <em>gradually</em> refining this into a technical document with illustrations, UML-diagrams or even running code or a 3d model."</p><p>Refining here means that the user guides the tool to transform freehand sketch into vector paths, then into vector shapes, then into something domain-specific and formal like UML - by adding additional data like annotations, strengthening of lines to "disambiguating" the transformation.</p><p>Needless to say, this is more a visionary thing. Realizing this would involve finding good solutions to a fair amount of computer vision problems.</p><p><strong>Making GEGL available for use in web-based applications</strong>. <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gegl-developer-list/2012-June/msg00010.html">Proposal</a>.</p><p>More on the concrete side: allow GEGL to be used in interactive or batch-oriented web applications, or in native applications based on web technologies (Javascript, HTML5 user interfaces).</p><p>Some of the discussions also resulted in me writing down the <a href="https://gitorious.org/mypaint/mypaint/blobs/HEAD/README.gegl#line45">strategy for GEGL integration in MyPaint</a> and the related ideas/plans for how to <a href="https://gitorious.org/mypaint/mypaint/blobs/HEAD/brushlib/PERFORMANCE">improve the performance</a> of the MyPaint brush engine.</p><p>Now we just need to implement all the stuff... Contributions welcomed!</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>Since <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2012/06/piksels-and-lines-libre-graphics-research-unit-seminar-in-bergen/www.piksel.no">Piksel</a>, with a long history in generative performance arts, was the hosting organization it was not surprising a project in that area materialized.</p><p>A workshop session hosted by media artist <a href="http://www.wintermute.org/brendan/">Brendan Howell</a> called <em>Demonstrating the Unexpected </em>came up with the idea of the <em>Piksels &amp; Lines Orchestra (PLO)</em>: think of the collaborative use of our traditional libre graphics software as an orchestra. The applications, from MyPaint to Scribus, are instruments; the people using them players; a performance the use of these instruments. Can we create an experience for an audience based on this framework? How would it sound? How would it look?</p><p>Having plenty of code-crafting people available, the next afternoon it was decided to spend a couple of hours realizing a prototype. The <a href="http://blogs.lgru.net/ft/theme/piksels-and-lines/turning-tools-into-instruments">LGRU blog has the details</a>. We recorded video of our initial performances with this prototype as well, but that has sadly not made it online yet...</p><h3>Thanks!</h3><p>Thanks a lot to Piksel and LGRU for sponsoring my attendance, and the EU Culture Programme and Bergen municipality for funding activities that support libre graphics and free culture!</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=565&amp;md5=cc7cd2464e8fda6acaf0406d61b740d0"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-97cb70cf-6a73-4680-9329-d2afb8024853" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="47"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="48"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>So, in the last couple of months I've been working a bit on <a href="http://www.gegl.org/">GEGL</a>. Some of the work has already been  <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/451417/">covered by LWN</a>, so I guess it is time that I blog about it...</p><p>GEGL is a generic image processing library which is used by applications like <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, (and in the future maybe <a href="http://www.mypaint.org/">MyPaint</a> and <a href="http://darktable.sourceforge.net/">DarkTable</a>). It provides applications with a graph based image processing backend that can do non-destructive processing of high-bitdepth images, among other things.</p><p>One of the problems that I think has been limiting adaptation of GEGL has been the entry barrier to starting to use it in a graphical application. While GEGL provides the image processing backend, it did not provide good and easy ways of displaying the output on screen. Now it does!</p><h3>GTK+, Clutter and Qt integration libraries</h3><p>Some code for integrating GEGL in GTK+ based applications has existed in the GEGL tree for a long time, but it was not well maintained and there was no public API. After brushing up the code to use Cairo for rendering and to support both GTK+ 2 and 3, it was split out to a separate library and repository: <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-gtk">gegl-gtk</a>. This library now provides a GtkWidget for displaying the output of a node in the GEGL graph, with basic support for scaling and translations. Any change in the GEGL graph will be reflected in the view widget. This makes it trivial for applications using a GTK+ based user interface to get started using GEGL, see for instance the provided examples  <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-gtk/tree/examples/gegl-gtk-basic.c">in C</a> or <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-gtk/tree/examples/gegl-gtk-python.py">in Python</a>.</p><p>The same functionality is provided for Clutter based user interfaces by <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-clutter">gegl-clutter</a> in form of a ClutterActor. This code was previously available as <a href="http://git.clutter-project.org/cgit.cgi?url=clutter-gegl">clutter-gegl</a>, but has now been renamed and moved to be a part of the GEGL project, and is maintained by <a href="http://pippin.gimp.org/">&#216;yvind Kols&#229;s</a>. <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-clutter/tree/examples/parsexml.c">Example code</a> in C.</p><p>Last but not least,  <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-qt/">gegl-qt</a> was created to serve the needs of applications using Qt based user interfaces. The different widget systems (QWidget-, QGraphicsWidget- and QML-based) are all supported. In addition to the features currently available in the GTK+ and Clutter versions, the Qt view widgets also support auto-scaling and auto-centering. Python bindings via PySide is planned, but blocking on a <a href="http://lists.pyside.org/pipermail/pyside/2011-August/002785.html">PySide issue</a> at the moment.</p><p>A pretty boring screenshot showing two QWidget based examples (code:  <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-qt/tree/examples/qwidget-transformations">1</a>, <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-qt/tree/examples/qwidget-autotransform">2</a>) for transformations:</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/2011-08-21-192538_1280x800_scrot_cropped.png"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/files/2011-08-21-192538_1280x800_scrot_cropped-300x198.png"></a><p>Artwork: " <a href="http://mypaint.deviantart.com/#/d3urag0">Wanted</a>", speedpainting by <a href="http://www.davidrevoy.com/">David Revoy</a></p><p>The first stable release of gegl-qt and gegl-gtk will hopefully be available soon. The list of tasks can be found <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-qt/tree/README.txt#n62">in the README</a><a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gegl-gtk/tree/README">files</a>.</p><h3>Display operations</h3><p>In GEGL, image processing is described as a graph of operations. "gegl:display" and "gegl:gtk-display" operations existed in the gegl tree, and by attaching one of these to a node in the graph one could display the output of the graph at the given node in a window . Such display operations are useful for applications that just want to show the output of a graph without having to use a GUI library directly.</p><p>The problem was that both of these operations were optional, so applications could not rely on this functionality to be present. This is solved by letting the "gegl:display" operation be a meta-operation, which uses other operations as a handler to actually display the output. Such display handler operations are now provided by gegl (optional, using SDL), gegl-gtk (using GTK+) and gegl-qt (using Qt). In addition a fallback operation that will export a PNG file and launch an external application to display it will be provided in GEGL.</p><p>More to GEGL stuff to come soon, hopefully.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=442&amp;md5=14ca04429b25a21a9512d0566aceb144"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-95b4420e-b5e4-4cf8-b823-243bff62dd78" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="49"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="50"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>Already covered in the news from LGM was the release of GIMP 2.8, and that <a href="http://gimpfoo.de/2012/04/17/goat-invasion-in-gimp/">GIMP 2.10 will be fully GEGLified</a>. The goat-invasion branch which has most of that work, the result of 3 weeks of <a href="http://pippin.gimp.org/">pippin</a> and <a href="http://gimpfoo.de/">mitch</a> on a couch hacking together, has already landed in master. This means that GIMP now has support for high bit-depth workflows for most operations. Finally.</p><h3>Putting the goat in MyPaint</h3><p>During LGM I started working on using GEGL in MyPaint. I have already mentioned this idea <a href="http://river-valley.tv/mypaint-%E2%80%93-the-past-the-present-and-the-future/">several</a><a href="http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/mypaint-1.0-there-can-never-be-too-much-awesomeness">times</a>, so it was time to stop talking and get hacking.</p><p>As a first step in making use of GEGL I wanted to replace the current surface implementation with one based on <a href="http://www.gegl.org/api.html#GeglBuffer">GeglBuffer</a>. Since GeglBuffer already provides tiling, and can store any buffer data supported by Babl this turned out to be easy. &#216;yvind (pippin) added the semi-quirky pixel format we currently use* in MyPaint to Babl, and I was able to get a rough working GEGL based Surface implementation the first evening.</p><p>* RGBA premultiplied alpha, in 16 bit unsigned integers with  2^15 being the maximum value.</p><p>The next couple of days went to moving to the <a href="http://gegl.org/api.html#GeglBufferIterator">GeglBufferIterator</a> API instead of gegl_buffer_{get,set} to have zero-copy access to improve performance, and improving GEGL and GEGL-GTK so that some of the hacks in the initial implementation could be removed.</p><p>Most of the work is in the <a href="https://gitorious.org/mypaint/mypaint/commits/gegl">gegl branch</a> of MyPaint. A simple test application, <a href="http://mypaint-gegl.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mypaint-gegl.py</a>, is included, and you can read <a href="https://gitorious.org/mypaint/mypaint/blobs/gegl/README.gegl">README.gegl</a> for how to try it out. Warning: only intended for curious developers at this stage.</p><p>A lots of work remains to be done for MyPaint to be able to fully use GEGL. The progress is tracked in two bugs, one for <a href="https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?19732">MyPaint work</a> and one for <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=675962">GEGL issues</a>.

Got to meet people working on similar things (at least in the same ballpark) as MyPaint, like <a href="http://krita.org/">Krita</a>, GIMP and <a href="http://www.nathive.org/">Nathive</a>. Also got to meet and hang out with some of the awesome people on the <a href="http://durian.blender.org/">Durian Open Movie project</a>. They were using, and were more fond of, MyPaint than I thought.  Also chatted with several other users, some of which were using MyPaint as a part of their workflow in a professional environment. Good stuff.</p><p>The entire conference was very professionally executed, no technical or organizational problems, yet they were able to maintain a nice cosy atmosphere. The only thing I didn't quite like was the food, but thats mostly a matter of personal preference (they only served vegetarian, and I'm a quite dedicated carnivore).</p><p>There were plenty of good talks, and if you're interested in them you should check out the <a href="http://river-valley.tv/conferences/lgm-2010">video recordings done by River Valleys</a>. I also attended some workshop/BoF sessions, here is my take on them:</p><h2>OpenRaster BoF</h2><p>The <a href="http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/OpenRaster">OpenRaster</a> BoF turned out to be quite different from what I expected. I expected only a couple of people from Krita, GIMP and MyPaint to show up. But no, we had lots of people attending, even professional standards people from Adobe, w3c and Opera! I also somewhat suprised myself (ok, I know that I like to talk and am not afraid to do so, but still), by taking an active role. We did get useful things done, like consensus on that we want to define a minimal baseline standard, and to have fallbacks for things extending upon the baseline. The concrete specs have not been settled, but hopefully we (MyPaint+Krita people mainly) can take care of that pretty soon.</p><p>I hope to try out some implementation ideas for fallbacks soon, and to improve the GIMP implementation, but school is keeping me very busy now a days. In fact, the first evening in Brussels was spent finishing my bachelors thesis report, and sunday was spent on my final report in my english class. And its far from over yet...</p><h2>A Libre Graphics Foundation?</h2><p>There was a birds-of-a-feather session for a potential "foundation" to support and promote libre graphics projects. Apparently these ideas have come up before, but this year it seems to be gathering some traction so it might actually happen. Different people have different views on what exactly it should be about of course; some are looking in the direction of Blender Foundation/Institute, doing open projects, funding developers, and having official teaching; others are more interested in having common documentation about libre graphics software for users. In any case, a common resource and face for libre graphics projects would be good. But in the end it will boil down to what people step up and make happen, I suspect. Discussions are ongoing on the create @ <a href="http://freedesktop.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freedesktop.org</a> <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/create">mailinglist</a>, so jump in if this tickles your fancies.</p><h2>LGM2011</h2><p>In the discussion during the last day, Montreal and Vietnam were proposed as locations for the next LGM. I'd love to go either way, haven't been to Asia nor North-America. Perhaps even do a talk of my own? Still, it's much further away, so it might require a very interesting program, depending what I'm doing at that time and how busy I am. We'll see. If if turns out to be more of an end-user conference, and less of a developer/contributor meeting I'd love to have David Revoy and/or Ramon Miranda do MyPaint workshops. That would be beyond awesome.</p><p>In the meantime, it looks like <a href="http://www.guadec.org/">GUADEC</a> will be my next conference, only 8 weeks away. I'm already excited!</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=195&amp;md5=46cb8be9869e65aba870be24359d021d"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-dbccf4e4-21dd-4330-8df0-20187778c400" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="53"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="54"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>MassifG is an application for visualizing the output of <a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrinds</a> massif tool.

MassifG is free software, available under GPLv3. You will find the git repository <a href="http://gitorious.org/massifg/massifg">at gitorious</a>, and the tarball release for 0.1 <a href="http://www.jonnor.com/files/massifg-0.1.tar.gz">here</a>.

This code was contributed by <a href="http://murrayc.com/">Murray Cumming</a> - thanks!</li></ul><p>I was hoping that I could make version 0.1 the "minimally useful" release, but I have to admit that it is not quite there yet. Instead I nickname release 0.1 "getting it out there". The main issue is that there is massif output that breaks the graph, see under tests/ for an example.</p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>MassifG is written in C, and uses GTK+ for its graphical user interface. Once the ability to export the graph is implemented, it should be easy to allow the application to build and run without GTK, if anyone wants to do that.</p><p>The parser is a simple state-machine. It might have been wiser to use bison+flex, and I'll reevaluate that when I need to implement parsing of the detailed output.</p><p>The graph functionality is implemented using Cairo and Pango. While Cairo and Pango are excellent technologies with nice APIs, they are quite low-level and that means having to care about all the details. As that brings no benefit to this application I might rewrite the graphing functionality to use the goffice library instead. Sadly there seems to be little high-level or introductionary documentation to goffice APIs, so I might have to fix that along the way.</p><h2>Roadmap</h2><p>In the short term I will:</p><ul><li>Implement parsing and graphing of the detailed massif output</li><li>Fix the graphing bug(s)</li><li>Add the ability to export/save a graph as PNG,PDF et.c. without having to go by the printing dialog</li></ul><p>In the longer term I'm considering:</p><ul><li>Adding the ability to run massif on a program directly from MassifG</li><li>An interactive mode which updates the graph while the program to be analyzed is still running</li><li>Making a custom widget which other applications can embed</li></ul><p>In the meantime, please do give the current version some testing, and report bugs and other issues.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=206&amp;md5=d22f50b5d237f1e10bd799efeea7ac7c"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section><section id="section-ArticleFallback-d5b2405c-4472-4a60-bd79-62fbbe81256a" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1 ms-p-2  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="55"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r p-2" data-reactid="56"><h1>Jon Nordby</h1><p>In learning Qt, I of course needed to get some experience with the newest and shiniest bits of Qt: Qt Quick.</p><p>One of the things I've done with that is to make a simple application, an image viewer called Imago. The code can be found <a href="http://gitorious.org/openismus-playground/imago">at Gitorious</a>. It is a bit different from typical Qt Quick applications as it is not a mobile application but rather targets the desktop. Thus I'm using standard desktop UI concepts like drop-down menues, and ordinary file-chosers.</p><p>The lists can be "flicked" through using the pointer, or using the scroll wheel. Moving between the views that show multiple images and the single-image view has a small animation.</p><h3>Implementation</h3><p>In a Qt Quick application two languages and runtimes are involved; C++ and the declarative language that forms the basis of Qt Quick, QML. Qt supports bi-directional communication between the two using a number of metods.<br> In my case I chose to make a QObject class that  maintains all of the central state in the application. This includes things like what folder is currenty open, the images in that folder, which image is currently focused/selected. All these attributes are implemented as QObject properties, and are notifyiable (meaning they have an attached signal that you guarantee to emit each time the value changes). Exporting this object to QML then allows these properties to be used in property bindings, or for one to connect to the notification signals.<br> So in Imago QML is basically used as a "stupid" UI layer for the image view. Other things, like window title and drop-down menues are handed by the C++ side, but by using the signals and properties of the same object.</p><p>Writing a desktop application means that one cannot assume a fixed window size like people tend to do for mobile device applications. With setting the resize property of the QDeclarativeView (the widget that displays the QML stuff) to QDeclarativeView::SizeRootObjectToView and using anchor layouts throughout this is possible, but it took me a good while to get working properly. Mostly because the concepts are new, and most (all?) the examples in the documentation seem to neglect this aspect.</p><p>The grid and traditional view are actually implemented in different QML files (though the delegate for the images in the list is shared). I did this to test how having several UIs would be like, and for a simple application like this it works out just fine.</p><h3>Where to now?</h3><p>Imago right now is very simple,  and could benefit from some added features and some designer love. I also just found a bug in the traditional view that needs to be fixed. I have documented these things in the <a href="http://gitorious.org/openismus-playground/imago/blobs/master/README.txt">README</a> file in case someone is interested. As I have moved my focus over to other projects, I probably wont be taking this application much further, at least not at this time.</p><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/?flattrss_redirect&amp;id=324&amp;md5=39b93d0ff7dc7c79e1e1dccec65db2e9"><img src="http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/flattr/img/flattr-badge-large.png"></a></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="57"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="59"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="60"><span data-reactid="61"><!-- react-empty: 62 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="63"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="64">Jon Nordby</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="65"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="66"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="67"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
