            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>geglfilter: GStreamer element for manipulating video using Gegl</h1><p>Gegl is an image processing framework used in projects like Gimp and DarkTable. It will eventually allow Gimp to allow non-destructive, high bit-depth image processing, among other things. And GStreamer is  the multimedia framework for GNU/Linux, handling video/audio/other playback/recording/manipulation on your favorite desktop/server/mobile/embedded system.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>cairooverlay: Generic Cairo overlay element for GStreamer</h1><h2>What does it do?</h2><p>I wrote the initial version of this in late January, and after some interations it was merged yesterday to gst-plugins-good, and will be in gst-plugins-good 0.10.33. This solves the feature request I filed in 2009, one of my oldest bugreports in bugs.gnome.org!</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>GTK+ application support integrated into Maliit mainline</h1><p>GTK+ application support for Maliit input methods has existed for a long time, but up until now it has lived in separate repositories. This has been inconvenient for users and for developers, and was the major cause for it to not be on the same level as the Qt support. This has changed as the GTK+ support has now been merged into the maliit-framework repository, and along side the Qt support. Maliit 0.80.8, which was released yesterday, contains these changes.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>imgflo 0.3: GEGL metaoperations++</h1><p>Time for a new release of imgflo, the image processing server and dataflow runtime based on GEGL. This iteration has been mostly focused on ironing out various workflow issues, including documentation. Primarily so that the creatives in our team can be productive in developing new image filters/processing. Eventually this will also be an extension point for third parties on our platform.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>sndflo 0.1: Visual sound programming in SuperCollider</h1><p>SuperCollider is an open source project for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. It is split into two parts; an interpreter (sclang) implementing the SuperCollider language and the audio synthesis server (scsynth). The server has an directed acyclic graph of nodes which it executes to produce the audio output ( paper| book on internals). It is essentially a dataflow runtime, specialized for the problem domain of real-time audio processing. The client controls the server through OSC messages which manipulates this graph. Typically the client is some SuperCollider code in the sclang interpreter, but one can also use Clojure,Python or other clients. It is in many ways quite similar to the Flowhub visual IDE (a FBP protocol client) and runtimes like NoFlo, imgflo and MicroFlo. So we decided to make SuperCollider a runtime too: sndflo.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Participating in Libre Graphics Research Unit residency</h1><p>Following the Piksels & Lines research meeting in June and being accepted in the call for proposals I am now taking part in the Piksel & Lines Orchestra residency, hosted by Piksel and LGRU, together with media artist and engineer Brendan Howell. Together we will further develop the Piksels & Lines Orchestra, a system that turns the traditional libre graphics tools (like MyPaint, GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus) into instruments for use in an performance setting.</p></article>]]></description>
