It is split into two parts; an interpreter (sclang) implementing the SuperCollider language and the audio synthesis server (scsynth). The server has an directed acyclic graph of nodes which it executes to produce the audio output ( paper| book on internals). It is essentially a dataflow runtime, specialized for the problem domain of real-time audio processing. The client controls the server through OSC messages which manipulates this graph. Typically the client is some SuperCollider code in the sclang interpreter, but one can also use Clojure,Python or other clients. It is in many ways quite similar to the Flowhub visual IDE (a FBP protocol client) and runtimes like NoFlo, imgflo and MicroFlo. So we decided to make SuperCollider a runtime too: sndflo.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="50"><p data-reactid="51">We used SuperCollider for Piksels &amp; Lines Orchestra, a audio performance system which hooked into graphics applications like GIMP, Inkscape, MyPaint, Scribus - and sonified the users actions in the application. A lot of time was spent wrestling with SuperCollider, due to the number of new concepts and myriad of ways to do things, and lack of (well documented) best practices. There is also a tendency to favor very short, expressive constructs (often opaque). An extreme example, here is an album of SuperCollider pieces composed with (+ an analysis of some of them).</p></div></div></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 color-title title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="52"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2 " data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="54"><!-- react-empty: 55 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="56"><h1 data-reactid="57"><span class="" data-reactid="58"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="59">Going to Libre Graphics Meeting 2014</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 60 --><div class="Attribution " data-reactid="61"><h5 data-reactid="62"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="63"><a href="http://www.jonnor.com" data-reactid="64">Jonnor</a></span></h5></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="65"><p data-reactid="66">LGM2014 will happen April 2-5th in Leipzig, Germany and this will be my fifth year attending.

To make it easy to manage many queues and worker roles we also use MsgFlo. This provides us with the required flexibility to scale: the queues buffer the in-progress work, broker distributes evenly between available workers, and with Heroku we can change number of workers with one command. But, it still leaves us with the decision on how much compute capacity to provision. And when load is dynamic, it is tedious &amp; inefficient to do it manually - especially as Heroku bills workers used by the second.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="105"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="106"></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="107"><!-- react-empty: 108 --></div></section></div><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="109"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="110"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="111"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="112"><span data-reactid="113"><!-- react-empty: 114 --><h2 data-reactid="115"><a data-reactid="116">jonnor</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="117"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="118"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="119"><div class="Link" data-reactid="120"><a data-reactid="121"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="122"><a data-reactid="123">Jon Nordby RSS</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="124"></div></section></div></div>
