It is essentially a dataflow runtime, specialized for the problem domain of real-time audio processing. The client controls the server through OSC messages which manipulates this graph. Typically the client is some SuperCollider code in the sclang interpreter, but one can also use <a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Clojure,</a><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SC/0.2">Python</a> or <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Systems_interfacing_with_SC">other clients</a>. It is in many ways quite similar to the <a href="http://flowhub.io/">Flowhub</a> visual IDE (a FBP protocol client) and runtimes like <a href="http://noflojs.org/">NoFlo</a>, <a href="http://imgflo.org/">imgflo</a> and <a href="http://microflo.org/">MicroFlo</a>.<br> So we decided to make SuperCollider a runtime too: <a href="http://github.com/jonnor/sndflo">sndflo</a>.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="46"><p>We used SuperCollider for <a href="http://github.com/piksels-and-lines-orchestra">Piksels & Lines Orchestra</a>, a audio performance system which hooked into graphics applications like GIMP, Inkscape, MyPaint, Scribus - and sonified the users actions in the application. A lot of time was spent wrestling with SuperCollider, due to the number of new concepts and myriad of ways to do things, and<br> lack of (well documented) best practices.<br> There is also a tendency to favor very short, expressive constructs (often opaque). An extreme example, here is an album of SuperCollider pieces composed with<a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/sc140/"><140></140></a> (+ <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/wiki/SuperCollider_Tweets">an analysis</a> of some of them).</p></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="47"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="49"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="50"><h1 data-reactid="51"><span class="" data-reactid="52"><a href="http://www.jonnor.com/2014/02/going-to-libre-graphics-meeting-2014/" class="font-title" data-reactid="53">Going to Libre Graphics Meeting 2014</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 54 --><!-- react-empty: 55 --><div class="Attribution op-60 " data-reactid="56"><h5 data-reactid="57"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="58"><a href="http://www.jonnor.com">Jonnor</a></span></h5></div></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="59"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="60"><p><a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014">LGM2014</a> will happen April 2-5th in Leipzig, Germany and this will be my fifth year attending.
