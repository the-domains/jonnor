### About Me

I currently live in Oslo, working for [The Grid][0]. I'm very active in the local hacker/maker scene, especially the [Bitraf][1] hackerspace.  
My current mission is to make creation of electronics prototypes and products as fun & rewarding as pure-software projects.

From 2010 to August 2012 I lived in Berlin, working at [Openismus][2] as a software developer, consulting on open source software for companies like Nokia, One Laptop per Child and Canonical.

Up until June 2010 I lived in in Tønsberg, Norway, studied Electronics Engineering at Vestfold University College (Høyskolen i Vestfold), and worked at [my local bikeshop][3].
