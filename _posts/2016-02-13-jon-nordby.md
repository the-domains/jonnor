# Jon Nordby

Are you interested in the overlap between technology, art and design; and free, open, libre tools that join these domain? Do you use Libre Graphics software like GIMP, Blender, Krita, Inkscape, Scribus, MyPaint (and similar), and want to meet the people behind them?  
Are you a developer of free and open source software in the areas of photography, graphics, page layout, design, publishing, typography, animation or video?
