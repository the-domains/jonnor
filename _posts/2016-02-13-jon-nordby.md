Looks like I will be joining [Openismus][0] in Berlin from July, as one of three trainees! There is [much to learn][1], but that's gonna be half the fun. The other half will be working with something I really like, free and open source software, and with [great people][2] in a very good environment.

Going from living in my childhood home with my parents, studying at the [local college][3], to my own place in a big city in a foreign country training/working as a software developer is going to be a big change. But I feel like a change, and I don't think it could have gotten much better than this.

But before that; Hello bachelors thesis completion and Hello exam preparations!
