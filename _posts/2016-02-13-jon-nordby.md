# Jon Nordby

I know spring is here when:

* Exams are so close I go to school on Saturdays
* I can go mountain-biking without having to use long tights and jacket, and most of the snow is gone on the trails
* Work at the bikeshop is so busy that I don't have time to greet my colleagues until 5 minutes _past_ closing time
* Allergies are starting to kick in

Spring is great, mostly cause it means summer is close; soon schools out and the weather apt for swimming.
