# MyPaint and OpenRaster talks

One of my goals for this year was to give a presentation at a conference. And I can now say that I have achieved that goal.

I gave a talk about [MyPaint][0] at [Libre Graphics Meeting 2011][1] in Montreal, Canada: [MyPaint - the past, the present and the future][2].

I will also be giving a lighting talk at the DesktopSummit in Berlin about [OpenRaster][4]. It looks like this will be [on August 7th at 14.00][5], but you should of course come for the whole week. Just look at [the awesome program][6]!
