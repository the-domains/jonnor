# Jon Nordby

Another day, another release. This release fixes:

* Missing axis labels - now it is explicit what each axis represents
* Inconsistencies with GNOME HIG: Button ordering in save/open dialog and missing ellipsis for menu actions which require further user input
* A error message on canceling in the save dialog which should not have been there

Ubuntu 10.04 packages are now in the [Openismus PPA][0]. Due to [scheduled downtime for Launchpad][1] it might take an hour or two before they are built. The tarball is [here][2], Fedora 13 packages here ( [i686][3], [x86\_64][4]). Arch packages are still [in AUR][5], and Gentoo packages in [Dave's overlay][6].

I've updated the [README][7] to include information about the roadmap and tasks to be done. Check it out if you're interested in improving this small tool.  
Hopefully there will be a massifg product in GNOME bugzilla soon (I've [made a request][8]), but in the meantime just report problems to me by email.

Here is yet another screenshot:
