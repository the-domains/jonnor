# Jon Nordby

Better late than never (links go to the announcements):

Packages for Arch Linux is of course available in AUR. I might also make some simple .deb and .rpm packages for this, users should not have to wait until spring to get easy-to-install support in their distribution.

The OpenRaster development tools (oratools), the reference library (libora) and qt/gdk support needs more love before we can tag 0.1.0 but hopefully it will be soon.
