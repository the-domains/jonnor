# Jon Nordby

It is not well communicated, but you can apparently write your own "tabs"/"panes" for the panel/toolbar found in the Meego Netbook UX. Hopefully this blogpost helps a tiny bit\*.

As stated by the [libmeego-panel/docs/README][0] in the [source tree of mutter-meego][1] there are convenience APIs for GTK+ and Clutter based implementations. But it seems you can also just use the DBUS API, in case you prefer Qt or something else. I found this out by searching though meego.gitorious.org after someone asked on \#meego

\*Since this should be documented in the platform API, I've of course filed a [bugreport][2].
