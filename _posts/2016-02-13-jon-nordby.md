# Jon Nordby

So, it is confirmed, I'm going to [LGM 2011][0]! I was at LGM [last year][1], and I expect this year to be just as good. Hopefully I'll also be giving a talk this time, about MyPaint and/or OpenRaster.

If you are interested in free and open source graphics software, or the production of freely licensed graphical works, you should go too! See the [press release][2] for more information, or go straight to [submit a talk proposal][3]. If you cannot be there but still want to show your support, please consider [donating][4].

I guess this means I should order the tickets soon...
