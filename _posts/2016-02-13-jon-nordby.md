# Jon Nordby

Next week I'm going to [Qt Developer Days][0] in Munich where I will be attending [Qt training][1] and [technical talks][2]. And almost just as importantly, meet and talk to people who do related things to what we do at [Openismus][3]. I suspect the overall style and feel of this conference will be quite different from past free and open source software events I've been to (like GUADEC and Libre Graphics Meeting). More business-y, perhaps even enterprise-y? None the less, looking forward to it.

In related news, I'm also involved as part of the local team for [Desktop Summit 2011][4], along with several of my co-workers. The initial announcements have just been made public; the conference will be held in Berlin August 6th-12th, at Humboldt University. Mark your calendars See for instance the [story by the GNOME Foundation][5], the [official website][4] or the [original announcement][6] for more information.

Hopefully I will also be going to the [Meego conference][7] in Dublin in November. Fingers crossed!
