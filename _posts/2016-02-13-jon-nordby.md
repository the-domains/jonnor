# Going to Libre Graphics Meeting 2014

[LGM2014][0] will happen April 2-5th in Leipzig, Germany and this will be my fifth year attending. In fact [LGM 2010][1] in Brussels was my first international conference ever, and convinced me that I wanted to make open source professionally.

I'm very excited about [this years program][2], because once again we have managed to combine bleeding edge developments in open source software for graphics and visuals, with a wide range of connecting fields: open hardware, design, art activism, free cultural works, research and education.

Personally, I especially look forward to:

* Richard Hughes: Building an OpenHardware Spectrograph for Color Profiling in Linux
* Johannes Hanika: Wavelets for image processing
* Manuel Qui√±ones: GEGL is not GIMP - creating graphic applications with GEGL (workshop)
* Libre Graphics Magazine: Beating the drums, Why we made gender an issue

I am also hosting a [BoF][3] session on visual programming of libre graphics tools. Curious to see what comes out of that.

If you are interested in open source and graphics, don't miss Libre Graphics Meeting.  
[Register now][4] (it's free and open for all)!

Can't go to LGM, but would still like to contribute? Please consider [donating to our travel fund][5].

I would like to thank the [GIMP project][6] for sponsoring my trip to LGM2014\.
