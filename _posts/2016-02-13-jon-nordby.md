# Registration open for Workshops & BoFs at the DesktopSummit 2011

As a member of the local organizing team for the [Desktop Summit 2011 in Berlin][0], I'm glad to say that you can now register your workshop or BoF session. These sessions take place during the last 3 days of the conference, and complement the presentations that take place during the 3 first days: The Workshops & BoFs sessions are hands-on sessions where people get together to _discuss and work_ on issues face to face.

Short excerpt from the [news entry][1] on the webpage:

> All forms of _hands-on_ activities that aim to further the Free Desktop are welcomed. Examples of such sessions include [BoF][2], project and cross-project meetings, workshops, hacking sessions and training/teaching sessions. Each session is self-organized and it is up to the hosts and participants to decide if the session is to be loosely oriented around a set of topics, or have a well-defined agenda.
> 
> The organisation committee would like to schedule as many of these sessions beforehand as possible. We expect over 1000 visitors and scheduling helps to ensure minimal overlap with other sessions and allows us to provide a clear timetable for the visitors.  
> The remainder of the rooms will be scheduled via the wiki but we urge you to pre-register and get a proposal in before the deadline, July 3rd!

I will be proposing a session or two of my own very soon, I suggest you do the same! [Use this link][3]
