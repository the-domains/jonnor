## Grapikslabor, MyPaint meetup, attending LGM2010

Very sorry about the wall-of-text-with-no-images. I'll do better in the future, promise.

While on [my trip to CERN][0] I spent a couple of days in the area of Zürich. On Sunday 2th of May I traveled from Geneva to Zürich (coming directly from a night-shift, ugh). There I attended [Grapiklabor][1], which is a series of workshops on graphics using free software held by Alessandro Rimoldi, a [Scribus][2] community member. On the schedule that day was vector based graphics with [Inkscape][3]. It was a very useful workshop for me, I now have at least a pretty good idea of how to use Inkscape to solve real problems.

### MyPaint developer meetup

In Zürich I also meet up with Martin Renold, the creator of [MyPaint][4]. In addition to attending Grapiklabor with me, he was kind enough to let me stay in his home in Winterthur for a couple of days. On Monday we went for a longer hike in a nearby forest, an I got a tour of the city. Of course, with the two most active developers together, the meeting also involved some MyPaint hacking:

- We did some design for [our oldest bug][5]; adding some sort of fixed size image functionality. The challenge is doing that without compromising on MyPaints infinite canvas feature, but still being intuitive and efficient for users, and being able to inter-operate with other applications in a good way.  
- We also approached the [usability issue with the current brush settings dialog][6], got a significant improvement committed, and a even better solution, in my opinion, sketched out.  
- Also committed was support for layer visibility attributes in OpenRaster, both in MyPaint and in GIMP.

### I'm going to LGM 2010!

I've now also confirmed that I'm going to [Libre Graphics Meeting][7] in Brussels, plane tickets have been ordered and everything. It will be my first LGM, heck, my first conference of any sort! There I will meet up with Martin, Alessandro and many other great people in the free software graphics community. Drafts of the program has been published on the create mailing list, and I'm really looking forward to both the social and technical aspects of the conference. Great things have come out of LGM before, I bet this year will also have some in store.

I might also have another, exciting trip abroad upcoming. If so, more on that later ![](http://www.jonnor.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)
