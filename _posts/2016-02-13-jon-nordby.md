# Jon Nordby

Already covered in the news from LGM was the release of GIMP 2.8, and that [GIMP 2.10 will be fully GEGLified][0]. The goat-invasion branch which has most of that work, the result of 3 weeks of [pippin][1] and [mitch][2] on a couch hacking together, has already landed in master. This means that GIMP now has support for high bit-depth workflows for most operations. Finally.

### Putting the goat in MyPaint

During LGM I started working on using GEGL in MyPaint. I have already mentioned this idea [several][3][times][4], so it was time to stop talking and get hacking.

As a first step in making use of GEGL I wanted to replace the current surface implementation with one based on [GeglBuffer][5]. Since GeglBuffer already provides tiling, and can store any buffer data supported by Babl this turned out to be easy. Ã˜yvind (pippin) added the semi-quirky pixel format we currently use\* in MyPaint to Babl, and I was able to get a rough working GEGL based Surface implementation the first evening.

\* RGBA premultiplied alpha, in 16 bit unsigned integers with 2^15 being the maximum value.

The next couple of days went to moving to the [GeglBufferIterator][6] API instead of gegl\_buffer\_{get,set} to have zero-copy access to improve performance, and improving GEGL and GEGL-GTK so that some of the hacks in the initial implementation could be removed.

Most of the work is in the [gegl branch][7] of MyPaint. A simple test application, mypaint-gegl.py, is included, and you can read [README.gegl][8] for how to try it out. Warning: only intended for curious developers at this stage.

A lots of work remains to be done for MyPaint to be able to fully use GEGL. The progress is tracked in two bugs, one for [MyPaint work][9] and one for [GEGL issues][10]. Because one cannot combine PyGObject with PyGTK, it will likely not be possible to fully integrate GEGL in MyPaint before [porting to PyGI and GTK+ 3][11].

Oh, in case the goat references are lost on you - check the [GEGL page on wikipedia][12].
