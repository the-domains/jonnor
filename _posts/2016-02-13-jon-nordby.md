# Jon Nordby

Two years after [moving to Berlin][0] and joining [Openismus][1], it is time for another big change. I learned a lot while at Openismus, and had a lot of fun both in and outside of working hours. Those of you who have been to the barbecue parties know what a great bunch of people they are. I'm very glad to see that they are now [going strong again][2].

In December I will join [Squarehead Technology][3] in Oslo as a Software Developer. There I will work on their advanced microphone array systems for acoustic cameras and acoustical zoom. The role includes both real-time programming, digital signal processing of audio/video and embedded Linux, which is pretty much exactly what I was looking for.

Here is a very quick demo of the technology, used for noise analysis: [Nor 848 video][4]

The array microphone system records 200+ channels of audio simultaneously. By exploiting the time difference between channels, digital signal processing can extract and/or visualize audio content at different positions in the recording. This can be done both in real time, and in retrospect (unlike parabolic microphones).

Fun times ahead!
