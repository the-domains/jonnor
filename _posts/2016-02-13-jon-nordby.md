# Jon Nordby

Last weekend I was in Brussels for my first [FOSDEM][0].

Friday I attended a planning meeting for this years [Desktop Summit][1]. Several things were on the agenda, the most pressing being the website and the call for papers which both should be finished in the coming month. I was tasked with organizing the call for BoF/meetings/devrooms. In a broader scope, I see my role as making sure _relevant_ non-KDE and GNOME projects know they are welcome. People involved in such projects are welcomed to submit talk proposals, or apply for space for a BoF/meeting just like a KDE/GNOME project, but for anything to come out of it we need to communicate this properly.

Didn't go to a lot of talks, but I had plenty of good discussions in the "hallway track" and in the evening events. Especially good was meeting up with [Claudio Saavedra][2] to discuss Meego Input Methods and the Gtk+ integration he is working on. I hope I was able to help him a bit in getting started.

Attended the [Libre Graphics Meeting][3] planning dinner sunday evening. I don't know if I'm able to make it to the conference yet, so I did not have that much to contribute, but I let them that Libre Graphics projects are welcome to the Desktop Summit. And that I might try to organize a MyPaint workshop at LGM.
