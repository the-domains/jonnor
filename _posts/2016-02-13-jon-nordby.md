# MassifG 0.2.1; now packaged for your favorite distro

\*if your favorite distro is Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch or Gentoo.

This is a bugfixes-only release, and fixes regressions in print/save functionality (which rendered [0.2][0] kinda useless, thus the quick point release) and a parsing bug on 32-bit platforms. Behavior of the open/save dialog has also been improved. Tarball is [here][1].

Packages:

I've pushed the package files for Fedora and Ubuntu [to a branch][2] in case anyone wants them. The packages should require little to no adaption to work on earlier distro versions than the tested ones. The Ubuntu package should also work fine on Debian. With time I might work to get the packages into the official repositories, but that is not a priority at the moment.
